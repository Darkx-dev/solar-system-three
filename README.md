# Solar System in Three.js

Welcome to the Solar System project built with Three.js! This project demonstrates how to create a simple 3D solar system model using Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for 3D graphics.

## Overview

This repository contains a tutorial-based project that showcases how to build a 3D solar system model. It uses Three.js for rendering 3D graphics and Parcel as the bundler for handling dependencies and build processes.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Darkx-dev/solar-system-three.git
   cd solar-system-three
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start a local development server and open the project in your default web browser.

## Usage

Open `src/index.html` in your web browser to see the 3D solar system. You can modify the code in `src/index.js` to customize or expand the solar system as desired.

## Acknowledgments
